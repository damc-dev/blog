Basic Web Infrastructure
------------------------

As part of an infrastructure development team, I know my area really well.  
What I don't have a strong foundation for is all the other pieces of infrastructure required to make it useful.
This blog post is the starting place for me to map out and build a simplistic version of that infrastructure from the ground up.

## Requirements
* Application (Duh)
* External Security
* Centralized Logging
* Metrics
* Admin Dashboard

That's quite a bit to bite off in one setting so I plan to build each piece incrementally leaving pieces out and then put them all together.
